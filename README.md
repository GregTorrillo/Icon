## Motivation: 
E-commerce and shopping online is a way of life that affects nearly everyone.  I wanted to build this app to have a better understanding of the entire process.  I chose one of the most iconic products as the centerpiece of my store.  
	
## Description:
Icon is a Full stack e-commerce app specialized in premium Air Jordan I sneakers.  It is built using React and Redux for state management on the frontend.  The backend consists of Express, Node.js, and MongoDB as the database.  Icon features include Register and Sign in pages, slider hero section, products categories, sorting and filtering functions, product page, cart manipulation, and payment checkout using Stripe.  There is also an Admin dashboard created with React and Material-UI that is connected to MongoDb and Firebase for management to add/remove/edit products, track orders, and manage users.  This app is responsive on all devices.  The backend was deployed on Heroku and frontend on Netlify. 

## Optimization:
When I improve this project, I would add more products, an image slider on the product page, homepage search capabilities, and a customized favorites and watchlist.
